# ðŸ”¬ Logistic Regression Malware Classification

This project uses **logistic regression** to classify malware data, comparing performance under different scenarios: using all features, using a feature selection method, and using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.

## ðŸ§ª Highlights
- **5-fold cross-validation** for robust evaluation.
- Compared three scenarios:
  1. Using all features in the dataset.
  2. Applying a feature selection method.
  3. Reducing dimensionality with PCA.
- Evaluated models using **F1 score** and **AUC**.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques
- **Logistic Regression**: Optimized for multiple configurations.
- **Feature Selection**: Analyzed the impact of selecting top features.
- **PCA**: Reduced features to key principal components.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- The performance of each approach was compared, with detailed insights into F1 and AUC scores for each scenario.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `logistic_regression_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing implementation and analysis.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
